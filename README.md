## Recommendations for Improvement

Given more time, the following improvements could be made:

- **Add a Content Management System (CMS)**: Integrating a CMS would allow for easier content updates and management.
- **Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: This would automate the testing and deployment process, ensuring that the application is always in a releasable state.
- **Add Analytics**: Implementing analytics would provide insights into how users are interacting with the application, which can inform future improvements.
- **Improve Test Coverage**: While some tests have been written, increasing test coverage would ensure more robust and reliable code.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Conduct an accessibility audit and make necessary improvements to ensure the application is accessible to all users.

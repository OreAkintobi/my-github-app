# Project Evaluation

This project is a responsive Next.js application built with TypeScript and React. View [here](https://my-github-app-sand.vercel.app/).

## Tools and Libraries Used

This project was built using a variety of tools and libraries to ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable codebase:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building JavaScript applications.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A library for efficient Redux development.
- **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework.
- **React Testing Library**: A library for testing React components.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.
- **PostCSS**: A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **i18n**: An internationalization-framework written in and for JavaScript.

## Recommendations for Improvement

Given more time, the following improvements could be made:

- **Improve Test Coverage**: While some tests have been written, increasing test coverage would ensure more robust and reliable code.
- **Add a Content Management System (CMS)**: Integrating a CMS would allow for easier content updates and management. All the content could be managed from a single place and the application's text and image assets could be updated without needing to redeploy. This would also allow for non-technical users to manage the content. I would use Contentful for this.
- **Improve SEO**: Implementing SEO best practices would improve the application's visibility in search engines. NextJS has a great SEO support and I would use it to improve the SEO of the application.
- **Add User Authentication**: Implementing user authentication would allow for personalized experiences and user-specific data.
- **Add Code Quality Maintenance Measures**: Adding things like in-project formatting and linting rules for the repo as well as pre-commit lints with the use of tools like Husky would be useful down the line. Also, versioning and tagging would make sense if regular updates are expected.
- **Add A/B Testing**: Implementing A/B testing would allow for testing different versions of the application to see which performs better. Optimizely is a great tool for this.
- **Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: This would automate the testing and deployment process, ensuring that the application is always in a releasable state.
- **Add Analytics**: Implementing analytics would provide insights into how users are interacting with the application, which can inform future improvements.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Conduct an accessibility audit and make necessary improvements to ensure the application is accessible to all users.
